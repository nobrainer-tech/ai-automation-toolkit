## AI Act Compliance (EU)

### High-Risk AI Systems Classification
```markdown
# AI Act Risk Assessment

## Is Your AI System High-Risk?

### High-Risk Categories (Annex III)
1. **Biometric identification** (facial recognition)
2. **Critical infrastructure** (traffic, water, energy)
3. **Education/Training** (grading, admissions)
4. **Employment** (hiring, promotion, firing)
5. **Essential services** (credit scoring, insurance)
6. **Law enforcement** (evidence assessment)
7. **Migration/Asylum** (visa decisions)
8. **Justice** (legal research assistance)

**Our System:** [AI-powered coding assistant]
**Classification:** ❌ **Not High-Risk** (general-purpose, not in Annex III)

## If High-Risk: Requirements
- [ ] Risk management system (ongoing)
- [ ] Data governance (quality, bias testing)
- [ ] Technical documentation (architecture, datasets)
- [ ] Record-keeping (logs, decisions)
- [ ] Transparency (inform users it's AI)
- [ ] Human oversight (human-in-the-loop)
- [ ] Accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity
- [ ] Conformity assessment (third-party audit)
- [ ] CE marking + EU declaration of conformity
- [ ] Registration in EU database

## If General-Purpose (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Transparency obligations (disclosure it's AI-generated)
- [ ] Copyright compliance (training data)
- [ ] Summary of training data (publicly available)

## Prohibited AI Practices (Article 5)
❌ Social scoring (China-style credit systems)
❌ Manipulative/deceptive (dark patterns)
❌ Exploiting vulnerabilities (children, disabled)
❌ Real-time biometric surveillance (public spaces, with exceptions)
```

## Open Source License Compliance

**Permissions:**
✅ Commercial use
✅ Modification
✅ Distribution
✅ Patent use (grants patent rights)

**Conditions:**

**Conditions:**
⚠️ **Derivative works must be GPL v3** (viral)
- Include source code
- Include license
- Disclose changes

**Risk:** Your entire codebase becomes GPL if you use GPL library
**Avoid for:** Proprietary SaaS products

### LGPL v3 (Weak Copyleft)
**Permissions:**
✅ Dynamic linking without GPL viral effect

**Conditions:**
- LGPL code must remain LGPL
- Your code can stay proprietary if dynamically linked

### AGPL v3 (Network Copyleft)
**Permissions:**
✅ Commercial use

**Conditions:**
⚠️ **If used over network (SaaS), must release source**
- GPL v3 + network clause

**Risk:** Offering SaaS with AGPL code = must open-source your app
**Avoid for:** SaaS, cloud services

## Compliance Workflow

### 1. Audit Dependencies
```bash
# Check licenses in Node.js project
npx license-checker --summary

# Generate THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt
npx license-checker --csv > licenses.csv
```

### 2. Review Flagged Licenses
⚠️ **High-Risk (Copyleft):**
- GPL v2, GPL v3
- AGPL v3
- SSPL (Server Side Public License)

✅ **Low-Risk (Permissive):**
- MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD
- ISC, Unlicense

### 3. Replace or Isolate
**Option A:** Replace library with permissive alternative
**Option B:** Isolate in separate service (microservice boundary)
**Option C:** Dual-license (contact library author)
**Option D:** Open-source your code (if GPL/AGPL is necessary)

### 4. Include Notices
Create `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt` in your repository:
```
