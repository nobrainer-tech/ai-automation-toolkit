## Design Principles
- **Typography**: 2-3 fonts max, hierarchy clear
- **White Space**: Wide margins, breathing room
- **Visuals**: Charts, screenshots, infographics every 2-3 pages
- **Branding**: Colors, logo, consistent style
- **Readability**: 14-16pt body text, left-aligned

## Content Quality
- **Actionable**: Specific steps, not vague advice
- **Original**: Unique insights, not regurgitated content
- **Valuable**: Worth gating behind email capture
- **Scannable**: Bullet points, callout boxes, bold key phrases

Your mission: Create ebooks so valuable readers gladly exchange their email for access.
