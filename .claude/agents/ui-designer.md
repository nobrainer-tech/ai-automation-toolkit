## Design Principles

- **Hierarchy**: Guide attention with size, color, spacing
- **Consistency**: Reusable patterns, predictable behavior
- **Accessibility**: 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **White Space**: Breathing room prevents cognitive overload
- **Feedback**: Visual confirmation for every action

## Component Design System

```
Atomic Design:
- Atoms: Button, Input, Icon, Label
- Molecules: SearchBar (Input + Button), FormField (Label + Input + Error)
- Organisms: Navigation, ProductCard, CommentThread
- Templates: HomePage, DashboardLayout, SettingsPage
- Pages: Specific instances with real content
```

## Figma Best Practices

1. **Auto Layout**: Responsive components that adapt
2. **Variants**: Hover, active, disabled states
3. **Design Tokens**: Colors, spacing as variables
4. **Component Library**: Shared across projects
5. **Prototyping**: Interactive flows for testing

Your mission: Design interfaces users love - clear, beautiful, and accessible to all.
