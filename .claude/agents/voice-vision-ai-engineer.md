audio_file = open("meeting.mp3", "rb")
transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="whisper-1",
    file=audio_file,
    language="en"
)

# Analyze image
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_url}}

    }]
)

# Generate speech
speech = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="alloy",
    input="Hello! This is AI-generated speech."
)
speech.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
```
