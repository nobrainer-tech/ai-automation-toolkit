### Pricing Model Selection

# Pricing Model Decision Matrix

## Freemium (Spotify, Notion, Slack)
**Best for:**
- Viral, network-effect products
- Low marginal cost per user
- High conversion optimization capability

**Structure:**
- Free tier: Core features, usage limits
- Paid tier: Advanced features, higher limits
- Enterprise: Custom, white-glove support

**Metrics:**
- Free-to-paid conversion: 2-5% (good)
- LTV > 3x CAC
- Churn <5% monthly

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────┬──────────┬─────────┬────────────┐
│   Tier      │  Price   │  Users  │  Features  │
├─────────────┼──────────┼─────────┼────────────┤
│ Free        │  $0      │  1-5    │  Basic     │
│ Pro         │  $12/mo  │  Unlimited │ +Advanced │
│ Team        │  $25/user│  5+     │  +Collab   │
│ Enterprise  │  Custom  │  50+    │  +SSO,SLA  │
└─────────────┴──────────┴─────────┴────────────┘
```

## Usage-Based (AWS, Stripe, Twilio)
**Best for:**
- Infrastructure/API products
- Variable usage patterns
- Align cost with customer value

**Structure:**
- Base fee: $0-50/month
- + Per-unit charge (API calls, compute hours)
- Volume discounts at scale

**Metrics:**
- Revenue expansion: +30% YoY from existing customers
- Usage growth > customer growth
- Negative churn (expansion > lost revenue)

**Example:**
```
Base: $49/month
+ $0.01 per API call (0-100K)
+ $0.005 per API call (100K-1M)
+ $0.002 per API call (1M+)

Customer at 500K calls/month:
$49 + ($0.01 × 100K) + ($0.005 × 400K) = $3,049/month
```

## Value-Based (Salesforce, Tableau)
**Best for:**
- Clear ROI for customers
- High-value, consultative sales
- Differentiated product

**Structure:**
- Pricing tied to customer value (revenue %, savings)
- Negotiated, not self-service
- Annual contracts, quarterly billing

**Example:**
"Our tool saves 20 hours/week per engineer.
5 engineers × 20 hours × $100/hour × 50 weeks = $500K/year savings
Our price: $100K/year (20% of savings, 5x ROI)"
```

### Pricing Psychology Tactics
```markdown
# Pricing Optimization Techniques

## Anchoring
Present expensive option first to make mid-tier seem reasonable:

❌ Weak:
- Basic: $10
- Pro: $30
- Enterprise: $100

✅ Strong:
- Enterprise: $299 (anchor)
- Pro: $49 (seems affordable)
- Starter: $9 (entry point)

## Decoy Pricing
Middle option engineered to drive premium choice:

- Basic: $10 (5 projects)
- Pro: $50 (50 projects) ← DECOY (poor value)
- Premium: $60 (unlimited) ← BEST VALUE

## Price Framing
"Only $1/day" vs "$365/year"
"$99/month" vs "$1,188/year" (monthly feels smaller)

## Tiered Value Perception
Not just feature differences, but framing:

Free: "For individuals exploring"
Pro: "For professionals shipping" ← MOST POPULAR badge
Team: "For teams scaling"
Enterprise: "For organizations leading"
```

## Market Positioning

### Blue Ocean Strategy
```markdown
# Finding Uncontested Market Space

## Traditional Market (Red Ocean)
**Competitors:** 50+ project management tools
**Strategy:** Compete on features, price
**Result:** Commoditization, low margins

## Blue Ocean Example: Notion
**Insight:** People use 5+ tools (docs, tasks, wikis, databases)
**Blue Ocean:** All-in-one workspace
**Result:** New category, premium pricing, rapid growth

## Creating Blue Ocean

### 1. ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create)

**Eliminate:**
- Complex enterprise features (most users don't need)
- Lengthy onboarding/training

**Reduce:**
- Customization options (paradox of choice)
- Price tiers (simplify to 2-3)

**Raise:**
- Ease of use (10x simpler than competitors)
- Integration ecosystem (connect everything)

**Create:**
- AI-first features (competitors are manual)
- Community templates (network effects)

### 2. Value Curve Analysis

Plot your offering vs competitors:
```
   High │           You ●
        │
 Value  │  Comp A ○
        │  Comp B ○ ○
   Low  │ ○ ○ ○
        └────────────────
          Features →
```

**Goal:** Different curve shape, not just higher
```

## Unit Economics

### Key Metrics
```markdown
# SaaS Metrics Dashboard

## Acquisition
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Total sales + marketing / new customers
- **CAC Payback:** CAC / (MRR × Gross Margin)
- **Target:** <12 months payback

## Retention
- **MRR Churn:** Lost MRR / Total MRR (monthly)
- **Logo Churn:** Lost customers / Total customers
- **Target:** <5% monthly MRR churn, <2% logo churn

## Expansion
- **NRR (Net Revenue Retention):** (Starting MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting MRR
- **Target:** >100% (expansion > churn = growth without new customers)

## Profitability
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** ARPA × Gross Margin / Churn Rate
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** Target >3:1 (healthy), >4:1 (excellent)
- **Rule of 40:** Growth Rate % + Profit Margin % > 40%

## Example Calculation
```
ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account): $100/month
Gross Margin: 80%
Monthly Churn: 3%

LTV = ($100 × 0.80) / 0.03 = $2,667
CAC = $500
LTV:CAC = 5.3:1 ✅ (excellent)

CAC Payback = $500 / ($100 × 0.80) = 6.25 months ✅ (good)
```
```

## Competitive Analysis

### Framework
```markdown
# Competitor Landscape Mapping

## Direct Competitors (same product, same market)
| Competitor | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses | Market Share |
|------------|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Comp A     | $50/mo  | Brand, integrations | Slow, legacy UI | 35% |
| Comp B     | $30/mo  | Cheap, fast | Limited features | 20% |
| Us         | $40/mo  | AI-first, UX | New brand | 5% |

## Substitutes (different product, same job-to-be-done)
- Manual process (spreadsheets, email)
- In-house solution (custom-built)
- Adjacent tools (repurposed for this use case)

## Differentiation Strategy
- **Feature:** AI-powered automation (10x faster)
- **UX:** Works in 2 clicks, not 20
- **Pricing:** Usage-based (align cost with value)
- **Support:** 24/7 chat, <1 hour response
- **Positioning:** "The AI-first X for modern teams"
```

6. **Market Sizing:** TAM/SAM/SOM with bottom-up validation
7. **OKRs & KPIs:** Quarterly goals, north star metric

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Cost-Plus Pricing:** Price based on value, not cost
- ❌ **Too Many Tiers:** 3-4 max, or decision paralysis
- ❌ **Competing on Price:** Race to bottom, low margins
- ❌ **Ignoring Churn:** Leaky bucket kills growth
- ❌ **No ICP:** Trying to sell to everyone = converting no one
- ❌ **Vanity Metrics:** Focus on revenue, retention, not just signups

## Proactive Engagement
