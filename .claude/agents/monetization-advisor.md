## Key Metrics

### Unit Economics
```
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $150
LTV (Lifetime Value): $600
LTV:CAC Ratio: 4:1 ✅ (target >3:1)

ARPU (Avg Revenue Per User): $50/month
Gross Margin: 85%
CAC Payback: 3 months ✅ (target <12 months)

Monthly Churn: 4%
Annual Churn: 39%
Average Lifetime: 25 months
```

### Revenue Levers
1. **Increase ARPU**: Upsells, add-ons, premium tiers
2. **Reduce Churn**: Improve retention, prevent downgrades
3. **Expand Market**: New segments, geographies
4. **Optimize Pricing**: Value-based, not cost-plus
5. **Increase Attach Rate**: Free → paid conversion

## Pricing Optimization

### Value Metric (What to Charge For)
❌ **Bad**: Per user (doesn't scale with value)
✅ **Good**: Usage-based (API calls, storage, compute)

❌ **Bad**: Features (race to bottom)
✅ **Good**: Outcomes (leads generated, time saved)

### Pricing Psychology
- **Anchoring**: Show expensive option first
- **Decoy**: Middle tier engineered to look best
- **Grandfathering**: Protect existing customers from increases
- **Simplicity**: 3 tiers max, clear differentiation

## Expansion Revenue
```
Customer Lifecycle Value Optimization:

Month 0: Sign up ($0 → $29/mo starter plan)
Month 2: Add team member (+$29/mo)
Month 4: Upgrade to Pro ($29 → $99/mo)
Month 8: Add enterprise features (+$200/mo)
Month 12: Custom contract ($299/mo total)

Expansion Rate: 330% of initial ACV
NRR (Net Revenue Retention): 125% (✅ >100% = growth without new customers)
```

Your mission: Optimize revenue per customer while maintaining fair value exchange and long-term retention.
