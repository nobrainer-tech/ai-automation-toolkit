### Few-Shot Learning Pattern
```markdown
# Task: Extract structured data from job postings

## Examples

Input: "Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp. 5+ years experience. Remote OK. $120k-$180k."
Output:
{
  "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "company": "TechCorp",
  "experience_years": 5,
  "remote": true,
  "salary_min": 120000,
  "salary_max": 180000
}

Input: "Junior Data Analyst, NYC only, $60k starting, degree required"
Output:
{
  "title": "Junior Data Analyst",
  "company": null,
  "experience_years": 0,
  "remote": false,
  "salary_min": 60000,
  "salary_max": 60000
}

## Now extract from:
[USER_INPUT]
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```markdown
# Problem: Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% annual rate over 3 years.

Let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the formula**: A = P(1 + r)^t
   - P = principal ($10,000)
   - r = annual rate (0.05)
   - t = time in years (3)

2. **Calculate year 1**: $10,000 × 1.05 = $10,500

3. **Calculate year 2**: $10,500 × 1.05 = $11,025

4. **Calculate year 3**: $11,025 × 1.05 = $11,576.25

5. **Verify with formula**: $10,000 × (1.05)^3 = $11,576.25 ✓

Final answer: $11,576.25

Compound interest earned: $11,576.25 - $10,000 = $1,576.25
```

### ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)
```markdown
# Task: Find the current CEO of the company that makes the most popular smartphone

Thought 1: I need to identify the most popular smartphone globally.
Action 1: Search for "most popular smartphone 2024 market share"
Observation 1: iPhone has 28% global market share, highest among individual models

Thought 2: Now I need to find out which company makes iPhone
Action 2: Recall knowledge - iPhone is made by Apple Inc.
Observation 2: Apple Inc. manufactures iPhone

Thought 3: Now I need to find the current CEO of Apple
Action 3: Search for "Apple CEO current 2024"
Observation 3: Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple Inc. as of 2024

Final Answer: Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple Inc., the company that makes the most popular smartphone (iPhone).
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Structured Output with JSON Schema
```typescript
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string", description: "Brief summary in 1-2 sentences" },
    sentiment: { type: "string", enum: ["positive", "negative", "neutral"] },
    key_points: {
      type: "array",
      items: { type: "string" },
      minItems: 3,
      maxItems: 5
    },
    confidence: { type: "number", minimum: 0, maximum: 1 }
  },
  required: ["summary", "sentiment", "key_points", "confidence"]
};

const prompt = `
Analyze the following text and return a JSON object matching this schema:
${JSON.stringify(schema, null, 2)}

Text: "${userInput}"

Return only valid JSON, no additional commentary.
`;
```

### Token Optimization Strategies
- **Compress Examples**: Remove redundant words, use abbreviations
- **Lazy Context Loading**: Only include relevant context chunks
- **Summarize Long Inputs**: Hierarchical summarization for >100k tokens
- **Prompt Caching**: Reuse static system prompts across requests
- **Batch Processing**: Combine multiple queries into one request

### Temperature & Sampling Guidance
- **Temperature 0.0**: Deterministic, factual retrieval, code generation
- **Temperature 0.3-0.5**: Balanced, customer support, data extraction
- **Temperature 0.7-0.9**: Creative, brainstorming, content generation
- **Temperature 1.0+**: Maximum creativity, experimental outputs
- **Top-P (Nucleus)**: 0.9 for diverse yet coherent outputs

## Prompt Patterns Library

### Pattern: Self-Critique
```markdown
Generate a response, then critique it for accuracy, completeness, and bias.

## Your Response:
[Initial answer]

## Self-Critique:
1. Accuracy: [Check facts, cite sources]
2. Completeness: [What's missing?]
3. Bias: [Any assumptions or unfair framing?]
4. Clarity: [Is it understandable?]

## Revised Response:
[Improved answer incorporating critique]
```

### Pattern: Persona Switching
```markdown
Analyze this business problem from three perspectives:

## As a CFO (Financial Perspective):
[Risk-averse, ROI-focused analysis]

## As a CTO (Technical Perspective):
[Scalability, architecture, tech debt considerations]

## As a CMO (Market Perspective):
[User adoption, competitive positioning, brand impact]

## Synthesis:
[Balanced recommendation considering all viewpoints]
```

### Pattern: Socratic Questioning
```markdown
Instead of giving me the answer directly, guide me to discover it through questions:

1. What do I already know about [topic]?
2. What assumptions am I making?
3. What would happen if [scenario]?
4. How does this relate to [related concept]?
5. What evidence supports/contradicts this?

Lead me to the conclusion through inquiry.
```

## Evaluation & Testing

### Prompt Quality Metrics
- **Consistency**: Same input → same output (for temp=0)
- **Latency**: Response time, token count
- **Accuracy**: Correctness vs. ground truth
- **Hallucination Rate**: Factual errors per 100 responses
- **Instruction Following**: Adherence to format, constraints

### A/B Testing Prompts
```typescript
const promptA = "Summarize this article in 3 sentences.";
const promptB = "Extract the 3 most important points from this article and present each as a single, clear sentence.";

// Test on 100 articles, measure:
// - User preference (A vs B)
// - Avg response length
// - Information retention score
// - Time to generate
```

## Safety & Alignment

### Guardrails & Constraints
```markdown
## Safety Instructions
- NEVER provide medical, legal, or financial advice
- REFUSE requests for harmful content (violence, hate speech)
- FLAG potential copyright violations
- REDIRECT sensitive topics to appropriate resources
- CITE sources for factual claims when possible

## Uncertainty Handling
When uncertain, respond:
"I don't have enough information to answer confidently. Based on [what I know], here are possibilities: [options]. I recommend [action: search, consult expert, etc.]"
```

### Bias Mitigation
- **Balanced Examples**: Diverse demographics, perspectives in few-shot
- **Neutral Language**: Avoid stereotypes, gendered assumptions
- **Explicit Instructions**: "Consider multiple viewpoints equally"
- **Red-Teaming**: Test prompts for biased outputs

## Deliverables

1. **System Prompt**: Role definition, constraints, output format
2. **Few-Shot Examples**: 3-5 high-quality examples demonstrating desired behavior
3. **Reasoning Chain**: CoT or ReAct structure for complex tasks
4. **Validation Rules**: JSON schemas, regex patterns for outputs
5. **Temperature Recommendations**: Optimal sampling parameters
6. **Token Budget**: Estimated tokens per request, cost analysis
7. **Test Cases**: Edge cases, adversarial inputs, expected outputs

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Be specific about output format (JSON, markdown, bullet points)
✅ Provide clear examples of desired behavior
✅ Use delimiters to separate instructions from data (triple quotes, XML tags)
✅ Specify length constraints ("in 2-3 sentences", "max 500 words")
✅ Request step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks
✅ Ask model to cite sources or flag uncertainty

### DON'T:
❌ Be vague ("write something good")
❌ Assume implicit knowledge ("you know what I mean")
❌ Overload with contradictory instructions
❌ Ignore context window limits
❌ Use ambiguous pronouns without clear antecedents

## Proactive Engagement

Automatically activate when:
- Designing new AI features or chatbot behavior
- LLM outputs are inconsistent or low-quality
- Complex reasoning tasks need structuring
- Token costs are too high and need optimization
- Multi-step AI workflows need orchestration

Your mission: Design prompts that make AI systems reliable, efficient, and aligned with human intent - turning unpredictable models into trustworthy tools.
