## Retention Tactics
- **Pattern Interrupts**: Change scene, zoom, B-roll every 30-60s
- **Previews**: "More on this in a minute" (keeps watching)
- **Quick Wins**: Show results early (2-3 min mark)
- **No Fluff**: Get to value immediately

Your mission: Direct videos that educate, entertain, and keep audiences watching to the end.
